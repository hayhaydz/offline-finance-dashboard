## [2026-02-08 15:00] — Fix: Resolve Svelte 5 State Warnings

**Summary:** Resolved 5 Svelte 5 `state_referenced_locally` warnings in the account creation page by decoupling `$state` initialization from props and using `$effect` for synchronization. This ensures proper reactivity and adheres to Svelte 5 best practices.

**Files:**
- `src/routes/accounts/create/+page.svelte` (updated)

**Commit:**
```
fix(ui): resolve Svelte 5 state warnings in account creation

- Decouple $state initialization from form prop
- Use $effect to sync form data after failed submissions
- Result: 0 errors, 0 warnings in svelte-check
```

## [2026-02-08 14:55] — Guidelines: Add QA & Validation Requirements

**Summary:** Updated `CLAUDE.md` and `GEMINI.md` with a new `🔍 QA & VALIDATION` section requiring TypeScript checks and full test suite execution after significant changes. Refined `ABSOLUTE RULES` to allow these necessary validation steps while maintaining restrictions on general command execution.

- `CLAUDE.md` (updated)
- `GEMINI.md` (updated)

**Commit:**
```

## [2026-02-08 14:45] — Cleanup: Remove Legacy Init-DB Script

**Summary:** Deleted the legacy `scripts/init-db.ts` script as it has been replaced by the tiered environment strategy (Drizzle migrations + seed script). Updated `docs/setup/database.md` and architecture reports to reflect the new database initialization workflow.

**Files:**
- `scripts/init-db.ts` (deleted)
- `docs/setup/database.md` (updated)
- `docs/architecture/environment-strategy-plan.md` (updated)
- `docs/architecture/environment-strategy-report.md` (updated)

**Commit:**
```
chore: remove legacy init-db script and update documentation

- Delete scripts/init-db.ts (legacy manual table creation)
- Update database setup guide with new migration-based workflow
- Clarify "Loose Mode" vs "Production Mode" setup steps
- Mark init-db deprecation as completed in environment strategy plan
```

**Context:** The `init-db.ts` script was a manual precursor to the Drizzle-based migration system. With the implementation of the tiered environment strategy, the database client now handles file creation and encryption pragmas automatically, while Drizzle handles schema migrations. Initial data is now managed via `npm run db:seed`.
